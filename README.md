Project Title
Unscramble Computer Science Problems

Description
In this project, I have completed five tasks
based on a fabricated set of calls and texts
exchanged during September 2016. I have used
Python to analyze and answer questions about the
texts and calls contained in the dataset. Lastly,
I have performed run time analysis of solution
and determine its efficiency.
